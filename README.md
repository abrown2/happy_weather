# happy_weather
Example clojurescript web app making weather fun. It attempts to graphically illustrate the weather forecast obtained from the UK Met Office - please don't take this too seriously.

## Mistakes were Made
This has been a training exercise for me as the first step from doing a few tutorials to getting familiar with some new technology - mainly Clojure/Clojurescript, but also React/Re-agent and Re-frame. As you learn you can see how things can be done better, but don't always have the time to go back and refactor. Also, as this is not intended to be a serious finished application, so there are lots of holes and UI issues that could do with being fixed to make it a robust application, but that is outside the scope of this as a training exercise.
